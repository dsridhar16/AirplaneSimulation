# AirplaneSimulation
We are given an ODE and we have to map the trajectory of the plane at each point. We will use The Forward Euler Method and Runge Kutta. 
Algorithm for Forward Euler: First, we shall use a while loop to go through all the different x-values and their respective y-values. Then, we will use the algorithm learned in class, y=y+h*f(x,y), and then we will subsequently plot the x-value to the y-value to get the trajectory. 
Algorithm for Runge-Kutta: Much like I said above, I will use a loop to go through the different x-values and their respective y-values. I will find the y-values using the algorithm we have been given in class: y=y+(h/6)*(k1+2k2+2k3+k4). I will finally plot these values to get the trajectory.
